title: 'Users and Teams'
---

As of version 0.6 of the Explorer, you can now manipulate users and create teams of users.  I've long felt that teams and team interactions are a key part of good software development, and the heart of Agile development is autonomous, well structured teams.  So I wanted to be able to visualise them!

Note that teams are not currently stored in the normal JSON project files at all - you need to enter the team information yourself, and save it yourself.  I recommend reading about [Saving and Loading settings](/tools/explorer/ui#saving-and-loading-settings) - though you can also save user and team information separately, more on this below.

## The Users and Teams dialog

To view and change Users and Teams, click the 'Users and Teams' button - it's normally hidden in the 'Advanced settings' control panel.

Initially when you have defined no teams, you will see a diagram like this:
