This is the books and research I've looked at - it needs a bit of cleaning, not all the papers here are actually useful!

I have notes that used to be here - I'm trying to clean them up, they'll reappear on another page soon.  (Inline notes didn't play nicely with Zotero which I'm using to manage the research)

## A note on research limitations

It's fascinating reading a lot of this research.  An awful lot of it draws conclusions, or _implies_ conclusions, based on one particular kind of codebase or kind of organisation; the trouble is, software development is extremely diverse, in kinds of organisation, software architectures, and software development practices.  And it seems a lot of academic research is done without much effort to think about these differences - partly because it's actually quite hard to get your hands on a diverse range of commercial software sources!  And quite a bit of research is 20+ years old, from giant organisations, so it's unlikely to talk about microservices or TDD all that much.

[GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23627482-your-code-as-a-crime-scene)

> A great overview of code-maat and other related code investigation techniques.  This was the book that started me looking at alternatives to traditional code metrics!

A collection of research work around a wide range of software areas - including a good summary of the Bell, Ostrand and Weyuker papers - these folks have a bunch of papers which build on each other:

* <Citation>(Ostrand, Weyuker, and Bell 2004)</Citation>
* <Citation>(Bell, Ostrand, and Weyuker 2006)</Citation>
* <Citation>(Ostrand, Weyuker, and Bell 2007)</Citation>
