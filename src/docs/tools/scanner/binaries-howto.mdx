title: 'Running Polyglot Code Scanner binaries'

** This no longer works!  I'm leaving the docs here for older releases, or when I fix them... **

## Fetching binary releases

Binary releases were published to <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases> 

You should be able to download the right file for your platform here.  Note I haven't tested this at all on Windows yet!  And I only have a single generic build for linux x86 and OSX - I can add more if there's demand.

### Getting it to work on mac OSX

OSX has a system to protect you from malware, called 'gatekeeper' - by default on OSX if you try to run the binary app, you'll get an error "app is from an unknown developer".  To bypass this I'd have to go through a complex extra stage of signing and bundling my tool as an application, which I'm avoiding for now.

If you are happy that the binary is safe - all the code that builds it is on github, so you should be able to inspect it yourself - you can run it by stripping the extra attributes that OSX adds when you download it, using `xattr`:

```sh
tar zxf polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
cd polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine polyglot_code_scanner
```

Then you can move the `polyglot_code_scanner` binary to whever you want.

If you don't want to trust the binary, follow the steps below to compile it yourself.

## If it doesn't work

I haven't been able to test the binary releases myself on many platforms, so if these don't work, you might have to revert to compiling yourself.  (Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/issues) though, and I'll try to fix it)
