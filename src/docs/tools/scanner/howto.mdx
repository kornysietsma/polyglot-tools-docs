title: 'How to run the Polyglot Code Scanner'
---

The code scanner is a rust program - this means I should be able to build and publish binary executables so you don't need to know anything about rust.

But I haven't done that yet - sorry!

So you'll need to compile a binary yourself.

## Fetching code and compiling a binary

1. Get rust - instructions are at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
2. Clone or fork the project from https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner
3. test and build with `cargo` the rust packaging tool:

```sh
$ cargo test
# ... lots of warnings but hopefully no failures
$ cargo build --release
# ... lots of messages and noise - compiling can be slow
$ ls -l target/release
total 14368

-rw-r--r--    1 korny  staff     1063 29 Jun 14:45 polyglot_code_scanner.d

$ target/release/polyglot_code_scanner -V
polyglot_code_scanner 0.0.2
```

All you need to care about is the binary `polyglot_code_scanner` - that's what you need to run.  You can run it from the target directory or copy it somewhere useful.

(You can also run the project with `cargo run` but that's slower as it runs with debugging and without a lot of optimisation)

## Running it

You can run `polyglot_code_scanner -h` for command-line help.

Usually you will just run:

`polyglot_code_scanner --coupling -o json_file_name.json <source directory>`

### Important options

"--years <git_years>" - scan through this much history.  Git scanning can be slow, and often you only care about the last few years.

"--coupling" - enables temporal coupling.  This can be very very slow to calculate - if you don't want it, don't specify this option!  TODO: link to temporal coupling explanation

## Output file

See [Data Format](/tools/explorer/data-format) for a description of the output JSON file format.

It's not pretty printed to save space - if you want it pretty, the easiest thing is to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) and run:

```sh
jq < file.json | less
```
