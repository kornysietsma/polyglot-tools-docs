title: 'How to run the Polyglot Code Scanner'
---

The code scanner is a rust command-line program - which means applications are compiled executable binary files, which you run from a terminal.

There are two ways to run the scanner - download a binary executable for your platform, or build it yourself from source.

*NOTE* I haven't been able to test the binary releases myself on many platforms, so if these don't work, you might have to revert to compiling yourself.  (Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/issues) though, and I'll try to fix it)

## Fetching binary releases

Binary releases are published to <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases>

You should be able to download the right file for your platform here.  Note I haven't tested this at all on Windows yet!  And I only have a single generic build for linux x86 and OSX - I can add more if there's demand.

### Getting it to work on mac OSX

OSX has a system to protect you from malware, called 'gatekeeper' - by default on OSX if you try to run the binary app, you'll get an error "app is from an unknown developer".  To bypass this I'd have to go through a complex extra stage of signing and bundling my tool as an application, which I'm avoiding for now.

If you are happy that the binary is safe - all the code that builds it is on github, so you should be able to inspect it yourself - you can run it by stripping the extra attributes that OSX adds when you download it, using `xattr`:

```sh
tar zxf polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
cd polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine polyglot_code_scanner
```

Then you can move the `polyglot_code_scanner` binary to whever you want.

If you don't want to trust the binary, follow the steps below to compile it yourself.

## Fetching code and compiling a binary

1. Get rust and cargo - instructions are at <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
2. Clone or fork the project from <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner>
  
    Or you can fetch the source code for a particular release from <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases>
3. test and build with `cargo` the rust packaging tool:

```sh
$ cargo test
# ... maybe some warnings but hopefully no failures
$ cargo build --release
# ... lots of messages and noise - compiling can be slow
$ ls -l target/release
total 14368

$ target/release/polyglot_code_scanner -V
polyglot_code_scanner 0.1.2
```

All you need to care about is the binary `polyglot_code_scanner` - that's what you need to run.  You can run it from the target directory or copy it somewhere useful.

(You can also run the project with `cargo run` but that's slower as it runs with debugging and without a lot of optimisation)

## Running it

You can run `polyglot_code_scanner -h` for command-line help.

Usually you will just run:

`polyglot_code_scanner --coupling -o json_file_name.json <source directory>`

### Important options

"--years <git_years>" - scan through this much history.  Git scanning can be slow, and often you only care about the last few years.

"--coupling" - enables temporal coupling.  This can be very very slow to calculate - if you don't want it, don't specify this option!  TODO: link to temporal coupling explanation

## Output file

See [Data Format](/tools/explorer/data-format) for a description of the output JSON file format.

It's not pretty printed to save space - if you want it pretty, the easiest thing is to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) and run:

```sh
jq < file.json | less
```
