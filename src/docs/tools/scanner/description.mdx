*TODO: this page is largely a placeholder, it needs more content*

The Polyglot Code Scanner is a commandline tool, written in rust, to scan one or many source code repositories, calculate a whole pile of metrics and other data, and store the results in a JSON file for later visualisation.

The source code is available at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner>


See the [HowTo page](/tools/scanner/howto) for more on how to run it.

See the [Data format page](/tools/explorer/data-format) for the data that it produces.
