title: 'Polyglot Code Scanner'
---

The Polyglot Code Scanner is a commandline tool, written in rust, to scan one or many source code repositories, calculate a whole pile of metrics and other data, and store the results in a JSON file for later visualisation.

See the [HowTo page](/tools/scanner/howto) for more on how to run it.

See the [Data format page](/tools/explorer/data-format) for the data that it produces.

TODO: a lot more detail needed here.
