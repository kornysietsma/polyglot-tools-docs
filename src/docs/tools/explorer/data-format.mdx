title: 'Data format'
---

The Polyglot Code Explorer relies on a JSON file format, which is fairly loose and not really documented ... until now!

The format is based on files used in d3 demonstrations, usually called "flare" - though I'm not sure where the name came from.

It's a very basic tree structure:

```json
{
  "name": "<root>",
  "data": { ... root data ... },
  "children": [
      {
        "name": "foo",
        "data:" { ... foo data ... },
        "children": [
            ... and so on ...
        ]
      },
      {
          "name": "bar.txt",
          "data": { ... bar.txt data ... }
      }
  ],
}
```

Every node is a directory or file.  You can distinguish them only by the fact that files have no `children` entry - an empty directory will have an empty `children` entry.

The `data` is where all other data lives - TODO more docs!
