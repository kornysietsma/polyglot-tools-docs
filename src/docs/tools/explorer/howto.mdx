title: 'How to run the Polyglot Code Explorer'
---

The [explorer](/tools/explorer/description) requires a data file to run - there is a sample one checked into the codebase, but in order to do anything useful you'll want to build your own.

This is currently a two stage process:

- Run the [polyglot-code-scanner](/tools/scanner/howto) with one or more git repositories - this will produce a quite large JSON file containing the code metrics
- Run the [polyglot-code-offline-layout](/tools/layout/howto) with the output of the scanner - this will add layout information to the JSON file

Then you can run the explorer.

You have two options for running the explorer:

1. Download a static release from github and serve it as a static web app
2. Run the exporer from node.js

## To run the explorer from a binary release

- Download the `polyglot-code-explorer` file from the latest release at https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer/releases 
- Unzip it somewhere
- Copy your JSON file produced earlier over the `data/default.json` file in the unzipped site
- Load the site in a static web server

There are quite a ways to run a static web server locally - many people have python pre-installed, in which case you can run a simple web server very easily:

```sh
# Check python version
python -V
# If Python version returned above is 3.X
python3 -m http.server
# On windows try "python" instead of "python3", or "py -3"
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

For a full example using Python 3:

```sh
$ unzip polyglot-code-explorer.zip
Archive:  polyglot-code-explorer.zip
   creating: polyglot-code-explorer/
   ...
$ cd polyglot-code-explorer
$ cp ../my_data_file.json data/default.json
$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)
```

Then open a browser to <http://0.0.0.0:8000> to start exploring!

## To run the explorer in node.js

- Clone the repository at https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer
- Install yarn (or you can use npm, but this is set up using yarn as that's what the react starter uses)
- Install yarn dependencies `yarn install`
- copy your JSON data file into the `public/data` directory in the checked out code
- set the environment variable `REACT_APP_EXPLORER_DATA` to the name of your JSON file (excluding the extension).  (react requires variables to start with REACT_APP for your app to see them!)
- run `yarn start` and it will run the explorer in a new browser window.
- you can set `BROWSER=none` to stop it opening a new window every time.

For a full example, these are the commands I run typically to process and view the QGIS codebase:

```shell
# in scanner directory
polyglot_code_scanner -c ~/samples/QGIS > ~/data/qgis.json
# in layout directory
node layout.js -i ~/data/qgis.json -o ~/data/qgis-voronoi.json
# in explorer directory
cp ~/data/qgis-voronoi.json ./public/data/qgis.json

REACT_APP_EXPLORER_DATA=qgis BROWSER=none yarn start
```

See the [polyglot-code-scanner](/tools/scanner/howto) and [polyglot-code-offline-layout](/tools/layout/howto) howto guides for more on the parameters these apps take.

See the [Explorer user interface](/tools/explorer/ui) page for more on how to use the explorer once it is running.
