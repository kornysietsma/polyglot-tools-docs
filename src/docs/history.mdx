title: 'History'

In 2016 I was asked to help evaluate a large and ugly codebase for a client, working closely with my colleague at the time [Ra-el Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ra-el-peters-697ba325/).  The client had started a big-bang re-write of their legacy code, but that endeavour seemed to be stalling.  We needed to quickly review both codebases and answer their key question:

> Should they continue with the re-write, or revert to the legacy code and try a different approach?

I was familiar with [Erik DÃ¶rnenberg's articles on Toxic code visualisation](https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/) but sadly most of the tools he referenced seemed to be abandoned, and other tools we knew of were quite focused on particular languages - this codebase was a mix of old versions of C#, SQL stored procedures, hand-rolled JQuery+JavaScript, AngularJS, newer versions of C#, and probably others we weren't aware of.  We didn't want to try to get SonarQube or similar installed and running in-depth metrics on this code - we wanted a quick way to get an overview, and drill down on the toxic parts.

I'd also read Adam Tornhill's "Your code as a crime scene" and was quite keen to use his [code-maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat) tools - which had the huge advantage of not really needing language parsers to work.  Adam pointed out that purely looking at lines-of-code might be enough - large files are correlated to complexity in many cases.

So Ra-el and I threw together some code, using [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) to count lines of code, [code-maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat) to collect other metrics from source-control such as rate of change and number of authors, and [D3 Treemaps](https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap) to show file sizes.

I tinkered with this for a while - it basically worked, but stalled a bit.  It was hard to extend beyond what code-maat offered - I added a module for indentation-based complexity, but both the scanning side and the visualisation were lacking - especially the visualisation, it was hard to change, and treemaps are just a bit ugly.

And that's where things sat from 2016 to 2018.  I did a bit of packaging up, cleaning up, I talked about it at a few ThoughtWorks internal conferences, and at the UCL's [The 59th CREST Open Workshop - Multi-language Software Analysis](http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/cow/59/) - and then didn't do much more.  (I also had a lovely toddler who took up a lot of my tinkering time!)

(Note if you watch the UCL video - I have read a lot more about metrics and research since then, I'm not sure I agree with all the thoughts of my past self!)

In February 2019 I was working on a project where I had the chance to play with the rust programming language - and I really liked the look of it.  Not only was it fast, with some very clever memory management and safety features, it also had a great community, and a great ecosystem.  There were libraries for counting lines of code, there were libraries for processing git history - all the things I needed for my code scanning.

I then had a gap between projects, and thought it'd be fun to re-implement my clojure code in rust - both because I wanted to learn rust, but also because the clojure code was quite slow - and I could tell it was going to get slower and slower, the more I dug into other metrics.

So I started what is now the polyglot-code-scanner.  It went remarkably smoothly - the existing rust libraries meant I could ditch code-maat and build everything in one rust program.

The UI was still pretty ugly though. I knew what I wanted - I'd done some reading, and found that Voronoi treemaps (*TODO* link to a page on this) were probably the presentation I wanted - but they were a lot of work to get running.  Also, my UI was hard to change - I was using just D3 and otherwise mostly raw javascript, and it was hard to make it interactive.

Later in 2019 I worked on a project with some react, however, and it was pretty obvious that what I wanted was a new react-based UI.  I also found the [d3-voronoi-treemap](https://github.com/Kcnarf/d3-voronoi-treemap) library, which appeared to give me an option of building the layout I wanted, in D3!

Unfortunately running the voronoi layout in real-time turned out to be too slow and buggy - but I worked out eventually that I could split the layout into a standalone program that ran in node.js, so speed was less critical.

So in 2019/2020 I slowly built the rest of the tools up.  I also decided to do some reading into the research behind Adam's books, which led to a fascinating rabbit-hole of research papers - I've already improved some metrics, and added a first stab at temporal coupling - and there's a lot of room for more growth.
