# Metrics and Visualisations

Most of these have their own page, as I'd like to eventually link to the relevant research.  At the moment the pages are quite short!

* [Programming Language](/metrics/language)
* [Lines of Code](/metrics/lines-of-code)
* [Indentation as a proxy for complexity](/metrics/indentation)
* [Age since last change](/metrics/age)
* [Creation date](/metrics/creation)
* [Unique changers](/metrics/unique-changers)
* [Churn](/metrics/churn)
* [Temporal Coupling](/metrics/temporal-coupling)

[Team Visualisations](/metrics/team-visualisations)
