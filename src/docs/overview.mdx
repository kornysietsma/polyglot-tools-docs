*TL;DR:* If you don't want to read all this, jump in and have a play with [the Polyglot Code Explorer](http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/) or [another sample with multiple codebases](http://polyglot-code-explorer-openmrs.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

## What are the Polyglot Code Tools?

The tools are an attempt to answer the question:

> How can we visualise large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?

As a consultant I quite often need to quickly overview a large complex codebase - these tools grew out of this need.

### Why visualisation?

I'm a visual thinker, so my main focus is on visualisation - especially when trying to spot patterns in millions of lines of code.

It is far quicker for me to look at a diagram and visually see trends, than to try to get the same information in a table of numbers, or hundreds of individual project pages.

There are many different tools out there for analysing code, but few that let you see a "big picture" view easily across diverse codebases.

### Why polyglot?

Polyglot means "speaking multiple languages" - in this case, it means these tools should work, to some degree, for any text-based programming language.

I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and many of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from ancient projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a headache.  And each tool probably produces different metrics in different formats - it's hard to get any sort of big-picture view.

Also many real-world systems don't use a single language - often it is better to use specialist languages for different tasks, rather than one general-purpose one.  For example one project might have a UI built in JavaScript and HTML, a microservice built in Kotlin and a platform automation tool build in Rust.

And sometimes, the behaviour of users and teams is as informative as what the code looks like.  With these tools I can now look at who has changed which areas of code, over time, and get a feeling for code ownership and team behaviour.  (sadly this only works for git-based systems at this time)

### Where did this come from?

The basic ideas came from [Erik DÃ¶rnenberg's articles on Toxic code visualisation](https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/) plus Adam Tornhill's book "Your code as a crime scene" <Citation to='(Tornhill 2015)'></Citation> - plus a lot of [research](/bibliography) that Adam's book lead me to.

I'm also growing these as I get new ideas, which may or may not be directly related to quality.  For example, there are a lot of features added in 2022 looking at individuals and teams.

See also [History](/history) for more about how this all started.

## The Polyglot Code Explorer

I talk about "tools" here, but at the moment there is really one main application, the [Polyglot Code Explorer](/tools/explorer/description) - which is the front-end component of three tightly coupled applications:

![Tools flowchart](/images/flowchart.png)

You use the [Polyglot Code Scanner](/tools/scanner/description) to scan your source code and produce a data file, then the [Polyglot Code Offline Layout](/tools/layout/description) tool to add layout information to the data file, and finally the [Polyglot Code Explorer](/tools/explorer/description) to view it in a browser.

There is also now also the [Simple Code Server](/tools/simple-code-server) which the explorer can optionally use to let you view source code inside the explorer.

For an overview of how to actually use these apps, look at the [Quick Start Guide](/quick-start) page, or other how-to guides on the left.

You can see a demo of the explorer in action at <http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/> (this might not quite match these docs, as I sometimes use it as a playground).

## Git Logging Tools

I actually realise I haven't pushed these to github yet! Which is good as I don't really need to document them :) Just suffice to say, I have some work in progress for trying to get yet another git log visualisation thingy working.  One day.  But the explorer has taken priority for now.

There's an older example of this at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/git-cd-chart-twuk2018>

## Source code

These tools are a mixture of Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript.

The source code is on GitHub:

## Other docs

I've also [written an introduction to these tools on my blog](https://blog.korny.info/2020/09/06/introducing-the-polyglot-code-explorer.html) with an update [on my sabbatical](https://blog.korny.info/2022/09/12/sabbatical.html) - and [talked about them on the ThoughtWorks tech podcast](https://www.thoughtworks.com/podcasts/code-visualization).
