*TL;DR:* If you don't want to read all this, jump in and have a play with [the Polyglot Code Explorer](http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/) or [another sample with multiple codebases](http://polyglot-code-explorer-openmrs.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

I've also [recently written an introduction to these tools on my blog](https://blog.korny.info/2020/09/06/introducing-the-polyglot-code-explorer.html) - and [talked about them on the ThoughtWorks tech podcast](https://www.thoughtworks.com/podcasts/code-visualization).

## What are the Polyglot Code Tools ?

These are a bunch of tools I've been building in bits and pieces over the past few years, in an attempt to answer the question:

> How can we visualise large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?

### Why visualisation?

I'm a visual thinker, so my main focus is on visualisation - especially when trying to spot patterns in millions of lines of code.

It is far quicker for me to look at a diagram and see some unusual colouring in one area, than to see the same information in a table of numbers.

### Why polyglot?

I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and many of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from legacy projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a real hassle.

Also many programs don't use a single language - we have a number of great programming languages with special "sweet spots" and it's quite common to have UIs built in a quite different language to services or systems tools.  But comparing them with language-specific tools is almost impossible - and there's a big risk of comparing apples with oranges and getting a not very useful view.

### Where did this come from?

The basic ideas came from [Erik DÃ¶rnenberg's articles on Toxic code visualisation](https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/) plus Adam Tornhill's book "Your code as a crime scene" <Citation to='(Tornhill 2015)'></Citation> - plus a lot of [research](/bibliography) that Adam's book lead me to.

See also [History](/history) for more about how this all started.

## Polyglot Code Tools

The main code visualisation tool consists of three tightly coupled applications:

![Tools flowchart](/images/flowchart.png)

You use the [Polyglot Code Scanner](/tools/scanner/description) to scan your source code and produce a data file, then the [Polyglot Code Offline Layout](/tools/layout/description) tool to add layout information to the data file, and finally the [Polyglot Code Explorer](/tools/explorer/description) to view it in a browser.

For an overview of how to actually use these apps, look at the [Explorer How To](/tools/explorer/howto) page.

You can see a demo of the explorer in action at <http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/> (this might not quite match these docs, as I sometimes use it as a playground).

## Git Logging Tools

I actually realise I haven't pushed these to github yet! Which is good as I don't really need to document them :) Just suffice to say, I have some work in progress for trying to get yet another git log visualisation thingy working.  One day.  But the explorer has taken priority for now.

There's an older example of this at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/git-cd-chart-twuk2018>
