*TL;DR:* If you don't want to read all this, jump in and have a play with [the Polyglot Code Explorer](http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/) or [another sample with multiple codebases](http://polyglot-code-explorer-openmrs.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

## What are the Polyglot Code Tools ?

These are a bunch of tools I've been building in bits and pieces over the past few years, in an attempt to answer the question:

> How can we visualise large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?

### Why visualisation?

I'm a visual thinker, so my main focus is on visualisation - especially when trying to spot patterns in millions of lines of code.

It is far quicker for me to look at a diagram and see some unusual colouring in one area, than to see the same information in a table of numbers.

### Why polyglot?

I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and many of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from legacy projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a real hassle.

Also many programs don't use a single language - we have a number of great programming languages with special "sweet spots" and it's quite common to have UIs built in a quite different language to services or systems tools.  But comparing them with language-specific tools is almost impossible - and there's a big risk of comparing Apples with Oranges and getting a not very useful view.

### Where did this come from?

The basic ideas came from [Erik DÃ¶rnenberg's articles on Toxic code visualisation](https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/) plus Adam Tornhill's book "Your code as a crime scene" <Citation to='(Tornhill 2015)'></Citation> - plus a lot of [research](/bibliography) that Adam's book lead me to.

See also [History](/history) for more about how this all started.

There are two main groups of tools at the moment:

## Polyglot Code Explorer

This is really three tightly coupled tools:

* [Polyglot Code Explorer](/tools/explorer/description) - this is the front-end visualisation tool
* [Polyglot Code Scanner](/tools/scanner/description) - this is a back-end tool, which scans directories of source code in many weird and wonderful ways, to produce a big data file for the explorer
* [Polyglot Code Offline Layout](/tools/layout/description) - this is a second stage processing script which calculates the layout information needed by the explorer - this is too slow to run in a browser so runs standalone!

For an overview of how to actually use these tools, look at the [How To](/tools/explorer/howto) page.

You can see a demo of the explorer in action at <http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/> (this might not quite match these docs, as I sometimes use it as a playground).

## Git Logging Tools

I actually realise I haven't pushed these to github yet! Which is good as I don't really need to document them :) Just suffice to say, I have some work in progress for trying to get yet another git log visualisation thingy working.  One day.

There's an older example of this at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/git-cd-chart-twuk2018>
