As things change I'll try to add them here, newest changes at the top. (Note that each project has a changelog.md file on github as well)

## 2022-08-29

I am on sabbatical!  A number of changes are incoming, and I'll try to keep basic docs updated, but they may lag behind the source.

A brief list of changes - see individual project changelogs for more:

### Done

* Moved the explorer to Typescript - this was a lot of work, but makes development and refactoring much easier.
* Modified the shared JSON data format, partly as it didn't work well with Typescript, partly as I want to make tweaks.  The docs will need updating!
* Added version numbers to the data format, so the Explorer can test it is using a data file that matches it's code!
* Added project name, and per-run ID (usually a UUID) to the data format.  The name is nice for the main UI, the UUID allows for saving state safely in browser local storage.

### In progress

* Adding a lot of features to the Explorer for viewing users and teams.  There is a lot of value in knowing which teams made which changes, who "owns" what code, and the like.  Previously I had the "code owners" visualization but it didn't really work - now the user can manually set up teams and then visualize their activity.
* This however means that I needed a way to save user-created teams - so there will be options to save state both in the browser, and as files on disk.

This is what viewing a project by team currently looks like:

Alas, I had a bunch of pending changes here which never got published - work exploded with business, and then I had a few big personal life events...

I'm publishing what I had in draft now, just so _something_ is posted - see the update below about temporal coupling changes.  But it might be a bit of a mess until I find time for a proper review of what on earth I was doing a year ago!

## 2021-03-27

Big changes have been made to [temporal coupling](metrics/temporal-coupling) so instead of accumulating changes at a daily granularity, they are much more fine grained.  Look at that page for details.  (This requires a new version of both the scanner and the explorer)

The Explorer 0.4.2 now has a feature where you can customise the URL used when opening files in a new window, so you can browse files on intranet git systems or others that differ from github.

## 2020-10-11

There is now an experimental code visualisation feature in the Explorer version 0.4.2 (it was in 0.4.1 but is nicer in 0.4.2) - so you can see quickly which users have made most of the changes to a file.  This is still a bit beta, and documentation is light.  (I'm rushing as I need to use these features on a project!)

## 2020-10-09

I've added a whole new application - if a very small one - the [Simple Code Server](tools/simple-code-server) - for serving up source code in a CORS-friendly way.  The Polyglot Code Explorer version 0.4.0 now has the ability to hook into this server, and show you source code in a side panel.
