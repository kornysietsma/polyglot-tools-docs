# Korny's Polyglot Code Tools

![banner alt text](banner.png)

The Polyglot Code Tools are tools I've been building in my spare time, for visualising and understanding software built in a wide range of programming languages (hence "polyglot").

## **This site is quite incomplete at the moment!**

The best place to start is the [Overview](/overview)

These docs should be published to <https://kornysietsma.github.io/polyglot-tools-docs/>
