# Introduction


![banner alt text](banner.png)

This is the documentation for Korny's Polyglot Code Tools.

It's slightly overkill to have a whole site for this, but the tools are spread over several repos so putting together a single place for docs seemed worthwhile.

## Background

I've been developing a bunch of tools for several years, to work on the basic problem:

_What can we understand about large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?_

I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and many of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from legacy projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a real hassle.

Also I love interactive visualisation - it's far more useful for me to be able to explore a codebase visually, than to have a checklist of numeric scores.

A lot of this comes from "Your Code as a Crime Scene" by Adam Tornhill, along with his other books, and a bunch of other research I discovered through his work.  TODO: add bibliography pages!

## Tools

At the moment, most of the development is in the main [Polyglot Code Explorer](/explorer) app and it's linked tools
