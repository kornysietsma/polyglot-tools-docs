# Korny's Polyglot Code Tools

![banner alt text](banner.png)

The Polyglot Code Tools are tools I've been building slowly over the past few years, for visualising and understanding software built in a wide range of programming languages (hence "polyglot").

## **This site is quite incomplete at the moment!** - hopefully it is enough to get you started though.

The best place to start is the [Overview](/overview)

These docs are published to <https://polyglot.korny.info>

Source code for this site is at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-tools-docs>

The site is built with [The Rocketseat Gatsby theme for documentation websites](https://rocketdocs.netlify.app/)
