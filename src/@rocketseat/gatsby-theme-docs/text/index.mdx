# Korny's Polyglot Code Tools

![banner alt text](banner.png)

The Polyglot Code Tools are a suite of free open-source apps for analysing and visualising large software projects.

They provide multiple ways to visualise code written a wide range of programming languages (hence "polyglot").  Most of the tools will work for _any_ programming language, as long as it is text-based!
