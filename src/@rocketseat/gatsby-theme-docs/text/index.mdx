# Introduction


![banner alt text](banner.png)

This is the documentation for Korny's Polyglot Code Tools.

## THESE DOCS ARE NOT YET ANYWHERE NEAR COMPLETE!

It's slightly overkill to have a whole site for this, but the tools are spread over several repos so putting together a single place for docs seemed worthwhile.

The best place to start is the [Overview](/overview)

These docs should be published to <https://kornysietsma.github.io/polyglot-tools-docs/>

Source code is at <https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-tools-docs>
